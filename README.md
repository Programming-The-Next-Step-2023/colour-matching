# colour-matching
A colour matching game where the player matches a target colour using a selection of colours presented on the screen. The game starts with a simple interface that displays the target colour on one side of the screen and a selection of colours on the other side of the screen. The player needs to click or tap on the color that matches the target color using a color palette. Colour palette will be relatively close to the target colour. Either options will be given as a palette of 4-6 colours, or maybe an entire colour wheel where the score is calculated by the distance from the target colour - however how this distance is calculated needs some Googling in the upcoming week. Ideas for scoring  / point deductions are welcome, e.g. time-constraints, incorrect choices etc. 

# Notes
- This game will be programmed in Python
- I have no experience with Python
- Should be fine
